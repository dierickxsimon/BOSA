To measure one index of social distancing behavior, participants were presented with an image of an adult silhouette surrounded by a rectangular border. They were asked to click a point in the image that represents how far away they typically stood from other individuals.\n","\n","Here is a heatmap showing how far participants reported standing from other individuals in the past week, with dark maroon indicating a higher density of responses obtained from a kernel density estimation. The mean response coordinate, +, represents a distance of approximately 98 inches (8.2 feet; 2.5 m).\n","\n","![Figure 1](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?download&size=medium&id=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0244974.g001)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"governing-title","metadata":{"id":"governing-title"},"source":["## Table of Contents\n","1.
